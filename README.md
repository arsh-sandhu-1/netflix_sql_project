## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes Netflixâ€™s catalog using SQL to uncover insights about the types of content, release patterns, regional contributions, top actors, and more.
A relational dataset containing movie and TV show metadata (title, director, cast, release year, rating, country, genres, duration, and description) was explored using PostgreSQL queries.
## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Compare content distribution between Movies and TV Shows.

- Identify popular ratings, genres, and contributing countries.

- Analyze release trends by year and geography.

- Detect high-performing actors and directors.

- Categorize content based on description sentiment (e.g., presence of violence-related keywords).
